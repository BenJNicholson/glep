# glep: grep utility in Gleam

## Background

I started this project as part of the CodeCrafters
["Build your own grep"](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/grep/overview)
challenge.

I went down a bit of a rabbit hole and learned about the
[Brzozowski derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brzozowski_derivative) on
strings in formal language theory, which can be used to implement regular
expression matching.
